1) Installation Notes for Unix
==============================

All you have to do is unpack the systemc_regressions-2.3.1.tgz file in the
directory of your choice, .e.g,

  > gtar zxvf systemc_regressions-2.3.1.tgz

This will create the directory systemc_regressions-2.3.1 containing the test
source code and scripts.

Refer to the README file on how to run the regression tests.


2) Installation Notes for Windows
=================================

Unpack the regression tests using a suitable compression programme, e.g., 7zip.

Refer to the README file on how to run the regression tests, but also to 
README_windows.txt for more details.

Note: You need Cygwin to run the regression tests on Windows.
      Cygwin is free software that can be obtained from:
