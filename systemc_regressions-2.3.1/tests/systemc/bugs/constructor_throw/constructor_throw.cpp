//  This tests a bug when an exception is thrown in 
// sc_module::sc_module() for a dynamically allocated sc_module 
//  object. We are calling sc_module::end_module() on a module that has 
// already been deleted. The scenario runs like this: 
// 
// a) the sc_module constructor is entered
// b) the exception is thrown
// c) the exception processor deletes the storage for the sc_module 
// d) the stack is unrolled causing the sc_module_name instance to be deleted
// e) ~sc_module_name() calls end_module() with its pointer to the sc_module
// f) because the sc_module has been deleted its storage is corrupted, 
// either by linking it to a free space chain, or by reuse of some sort
// g) the m_simc field is garbage
// h) the m_object_manager field is also garbage
// i) an exception occurs
// 
// This does not happen for automatic sc_module instances since the 
// storage for the module is not reclaimed its just part of the stack. 
// 
// I am fixing this by having the destructor for sc_module clear the 
// module pointer in its sc_module_name instance. That cuts things at 
// step (e) above, since the pointer will be null if the module has 
// already been deleted. To make sure the module stack is okay, I call 
// end-module() in ~sc_module in the case where there is an 
// sc_module_name pointer lying around.
