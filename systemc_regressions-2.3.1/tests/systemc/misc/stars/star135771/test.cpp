/*
Hi,

Im using SystemC 2.0b2 with gcc 2.95.3 (Linux). If I create an sc_lv 
assignment with range methods on every side like

lv1.range(15,8) = lv2.range(7,0);

and the lv2 vector contains "z", I get the warning message

WARNING: (E2004) sc_bv cannot contain values X and Z :
 - ../../../../../src/sysc/datatypes/bit/sc_bv.h: 340

and the assignment is not done. Further investigation revealed that the 
vector seems to get mistakenly converted to a sc_bv in between. Removing the 
range method on one side or adding a cast

lv1.range(15,8) = (sc_lv<8>)lv2.range(7,0);

solves that problem.

Regards, S. Heithecker

#include "systemc.h"

int
sc_main( int, char*[] )
{
    sc_lv<16> a( "01ZX0000111101ZX" );
    sc_lv<16> b;

    b.range( 15, 8 ) = a.range( 7, 0 );
    cout << a << endl;
    cout << b << endl;

    return 0;
}
