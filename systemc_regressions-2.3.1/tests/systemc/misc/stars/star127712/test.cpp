/*
If a process is sensitive to sc_port<some_if<T>, N> and
this port is bind to two signals, the process is responding
to only the events on first signal, it's not responding to
events on second (or other) signals. it seems to me as a
bug. how to resolve this problem?? 

Thanks in advance,
kiran

when i run the following program i got this output.
0: Method Activated
0: Method Activated
3: Method Activated

but expected output is,
0: Method Activated
0: Method Activated
1: Method Activated
2: Method Activated
3: Method Activated
