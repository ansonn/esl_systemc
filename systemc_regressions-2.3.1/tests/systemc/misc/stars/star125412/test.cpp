/*
I believe there is a bug in SystemC 2.0 beta 1 which
causes simulation to end prematurely in certain cases.
Specifically, if an event notification occurs at a particular
time but no processes are ready to run at that time,
simulation will end. However, there may still be processes
that need to be run at future times.

Below I've included an example which demonstrates the bug,
and below that I've provided a proposed fix for the bug.

// This SystemC 2.0 example shows the bug...
*/

#include <systemc.h>

class top : public sc_module
{
   public:
     SC_HAS_PROCESS(top);

     top(sc_module_name name) : sc_module(name)
     {
         SC_THREAD(main);
     }

     void main()
     {
         sc_event e;

         // comment out the following line to see bug go away

         e.notify(55, SC_NS);

         for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
         {
           wait(10, SC_NS);
           cout << "main thread at time " << sc_time_stamp() << endl;
         }
     }
};

int sc_main (int argc , char *argv[])
{
   top top1("Top1");
   sc_start();
   return 0;
}

/*
/////// End of example

The proposed fix for this in SystemC 2.0 beta 1 is:

Edit src/sysc/kernel/sc_simcontext.cpp

Lines 801-802, which read:

// no more runnable processes
break;

Should be changed to read:

// no runnable processes at current time, but maybe in future
t = next_time();
continue;

The same changes should be applied at lines 845-846
Then rebuild and reinstall the SystemC library.
