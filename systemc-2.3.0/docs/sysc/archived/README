README for the archived SystemC documentation
=============================================

This archive directory contains old documentation, much of which is now out-of-date.
SystemC is now defined by the IEEE Std 1666 Language Reference Manual, which may be obtained by visiting <http://www.accellera.org/>.

The current directory contains the following files:

WhitePaper20.pdf - Introduction to SystemC 2.0

FuncSpec20.pdf   - Functional specification for SystemC 2.0

UserGuide20.pdf  - SystemC 2.0 User's Guide

SystemC_2_1_overview.pdf - An overview of new features in SystemC 2.1

SystemC_2_1_features.pdf - A more detailed description of new features in 2.1

Note that the SystemC 2.0 User's Guide covers primarily the SystemC 1.0
language features. We recommend that you use the combination of the
SystemC 2.0 User's Guide and the Functional Specification for SystemC 2.0
as a User's Guide for the SystemC 2.0 language.
