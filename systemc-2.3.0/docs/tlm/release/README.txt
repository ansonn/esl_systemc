  TLM_2_0_presentation.pdf
  An introductory training overview of TLM 2.0.

  NOTE: Powerpoint 97 does not render this presentation's animations or the 
        smart graphics properly, so Powerpoint 2003 or 2007 are recommended.

* TLM_2_0_requirements.pdf
  Original requirements that drove development of TLM 2.0.

* TLM_2_0_white_paper.pdf
  This whitepaper was provided at the time of the original requirements.
  It is necessarily high-level and devoid of any specific detail.
