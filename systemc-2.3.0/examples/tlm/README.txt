Running the examples:
---------------------

Support for building the examples and unit tests is provided for 'unix', and
'msvc' (project and make files).

Makefiles work hierarchically. The default target builds the tests; 
Other targets are:
   'clean', 
   'run'  (executes built tests/examples) 
   'check' (against expected results)

To run the makefiles the following environment needs to be set:
   On Unix/Linux/MacOS,
      $SYSTEMC_HOME should point to the SystemC installation
      $TARGET_ARCH defines the appendix of the SystemC library directory
      these should be set such that $SYSTEMC_HOME/lib-$TARGET_ARCH is a
      directory containing the SystemC library.
   On Windows, the SYSTEMC environment variable should be used.

To run the Visual C++ solutions (.sln) or project (.vcproj) files, you must edit 
the Property sheet as follows:

1 Select Property Manager from the View menu
2 Under projectName > Debug | Win32 select systemc
3 Select Properties from the View menu
4 Select User Macros under Common Properties
5 Update the SYSTEMC entry and apply


The examples:
-------------

Each examples comes with documentation in the form of a set of powerpoint slides
that can be found in the docs/ subdirectory of the example.
