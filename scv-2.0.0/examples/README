Examples:

1. Overview (subdir: general)

   hello    : part of a venerable tradition, does nothing useful  

2. Manipulation of Arbitrary Data Types (subdir: extensions)

   ex_01_userdata : create an extension for a user defined data type 
   ex_02_enumdata : create an extension for an enumerated data type
   ex_03_nestdata : create an extension for a datatype whose definition 
                    contains the definition of another datatype
   introspection1 : well-annotated example illustrates several aspects 
                    to the use of extensions
   private        : how to create an extension for a data structure 

3. Randomization, Constraints, and Weight Specification (subdir: randomization)

   constraints           : techniques for applying and changing constraints
   debug                 : provides a few pointers on debugging constraints
   ex_04_simplerand      : how to randomize data 
   ex_05_disablerand     : disable randomization for certain elements 
   ex_07_seedfile        : seed file to control the randomization seeds
   ex_08_dist            : create a distribution of values 
   ex_09_distrange       : create a distribution range 
   ex_10_basicconstraint : create a constraint between data objects
   ex_11_softconstraint  : create soft constraints 
   ex_12_hier_constraint : create hierarchical constraints
   ex_13_custom_next     : overload the operation of the next() method 
                           inside a constraint
   pythagoras            : integer solutions to the Pythagorean Theorem

4. Variable and Transaction Recording (subdir: transactions)

   overview : small design using extensions, constrained randomization, 
              and transactions

5. Miscellaneous Supporting Facilities (subdir: data_structures)

   scv_bag          : basic usage of the scv_bag data structure
   scv_sparse_array : basic usage of the scv_sparse_array data structure
