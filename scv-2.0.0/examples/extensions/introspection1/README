Description:

This test is based upon a prototype created by C. Norris Ip, Stuart
Swan, and Jasvinder Singh from Cadence Design Systems, Inc. for
distribution to the SystemC Verification Working Group as an example
of various introspection scenarios.

This tests basic manipulation of a simple user-specified composite
type.

Until the rest of the test infrastructure is in place, use runme.ns to 
run the test.
