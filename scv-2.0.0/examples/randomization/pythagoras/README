This simple example uses the SCV constraint solver to find 
integer solutions to the Pythagorean Theorem:

  a*a + b*b == c*c

The following source files are part of this example:
  test.cpp   a simple example.

When you run the testcase, it will print out the number of 
solutions it will calculate; after a delay, it will print 
the solutions.  During the delay, SCV is building the data 
structures it uses to enforce the constraints.  This 
overhead occurs once: generating the constrained random
values themselves is relatively fast.

To run this example, do one of the following:

  unix> make sun-gnu
  unix> make hppa-native
  unix> make linux
