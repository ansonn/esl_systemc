This is a very simple example to show how a user can use
soft constraints that the constraint solver will attempt to
use. This example extends example 10 by adding a set of soft
constraints that will not be satisfied.

The following source files are part of this example:

  test.cc   A test that contains a constraint definition
            and a test that uses the constraint
  Makefile  Targets for sun-gnu, hppa-native and linux

A makefile for use with SystemC is provided with targets for
three different platforms:

  make sun-gnu        # Gnu C++ compiler on Sun
  make hppa-native    # HP C++ compiler on HP
  make linux          # Gnu C++ compiler on Linux
