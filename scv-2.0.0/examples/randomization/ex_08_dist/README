This is a very simple example to show how a user
can create a distribution of values when randomizing
an object. In this case, a distribution is created for an
enumerated data type. The distributed values that are
generated will fall in the distribution that is applied.


The following source files are part of this example:

  data.h      The definition of a user-defined structure that
              has an enumerated type
  data_ext.h  Extensions for the user-defined structures
  test.cc     A test that uses the introspection interface to
              randomize the data objects; uses a scv_bag object
              to create the distribution
  Makefile    Targets for sun-gnu, hppa-native and linux

A makefile for use with SystemC is provided with targets for
three different platforms:

  make sun-gnu        # Gnu C++ compiler on Sun
  make hppa-native    # HP C++ compiler on HP
  make linux          # Gnu C++ compiler on Linux
