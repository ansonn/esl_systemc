WHAT IS DDDMP
=============

The DDDMP package defines formats for DD storage on file, and it contains a
set of functions to dump DDs and DD forests on file.

In the present implementation, only BDDs (ROBDDs) of the CUDD package
(version 2.2.0 or higher) are supported.



MAKE DDDMP
==========

Before you build the libraries and programs, you need to check the
Makefile in the top directory.
Go through the definitions contained in the configuration section, and select
the desired compiler and compilation flags.
Instructions are provided in the comments of the Makefile.

Then run "make".
This should produce the dddmplib.a library.
